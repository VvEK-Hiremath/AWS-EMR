In the twilight's gentle closing,
Where the stars begin their posing,
Lies a tale as old as time, in the night sky vast, imposing.

There, the constellations gather,
In a dance that whispers rather
Of the secrets held in cosmos, far beyond what minds can fathom.

Orion, with his belt so bright,
Guides the sailors through the night,
His bow and arrow ready, in the celestial fight.

The Great Bear turns in endless chase,
Across the starlit, boundless space,
Guiding lost souls homeward, with her calm, eternal grace.

And there, the North Star stands alone,
A steadfast, ancient, glowing stone,
A beacon for the wanderers, in the dark seas, unknown.

The Milky Way, a river wide,
With stars like pebbles by its side,
Tells stories of the ages, in its cosmic, silvery tide.

Pleiades, the sisters seven,
Shine like jewels, gifts of heaven,
Whispering tales of old, in the deep heart of the even.

In the silence of the night,
Where the stars shine oh so bright,
We ponder on our place, in the endless sea of light.

Each star, a distant, burning sun,
A cosmic race that's never done,
In the great celestial ballet, that the universe has spun.

So we gaze upon the night,
In awe of the eternal light,
And dream of what lies yonder, past the reach of human sight.

In the stars, our stories blend,
In a tapestry that has no end,
Under the watchful eyes of night, our silent, ancient friend.

In Kipling's style, with metered rhyme,
This ode to stars, through space and time,
Reflects the awe and wonder, of the night sky, so sublime.
